<p>Unit 3: Project Creation and Documentation

    Learning and Documentation
    Objective: If you are still learning new tools or technologies, document your learning process.
    Deliverable: Submit a detailed log of what you have learned so far.

    Create a “Learning Journal” in your GitHub repository, documenting:
    What tutorials, articles, or videos you've completed.
    Key takeaways and challenges faced.
    How the new knowledge will apply to your project.
    Share links to any code snippets or small prototypes you’ve created while learning.
    Code Documentation
    Objective: Continue documenting your code and process in GitHub.
    Deliverable: Update README.md with:
    A clearer description of your project’s purpose.
    Details on how to run your project (if applicable).
    A list of features currently implemented and planned.

<h2>Cybrary Topics</h2>


    <h4>Operating System Fundamentals - Learn the basics of the Windows and Linux operating systems. This topic will cover command line interfaces, file systems, Windows services, Active Directory, and Group Policy.</h4>
    
    
    <h4>Network Fundamentals - Learn the basics of communications and networking. This topic will cover the OSI and TCP/IP reference models, IP addressing, network devices, Wireshark, Nmap, VPNs, and network troubleshooting.</h4>
    
    
    <h4>Cybersecurity Fundamentals - Learn the basics of cybersecurity. This broad topic will cover several key cybersecurity concepts and technologies, including cryptography, access control, backup and recovery, patching, antivirus, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and vulnerability scanners.</h4>
    
    
    <h4>Scripting and Programming Fundamentals - Learn the basics of widely used scripting and programming languages. This topic will cover BASH, PowerShell, and Python.</h4>
    
    
    <h2>Cybrary Outline<h2>
      
    <h3>I have made good progress on Cybrary, and I have figured out how to sign up for access to a practice book to help me get certified for the certified in cybersecurity exam through ISC2 I have worked on Cybrary the whole week during class and starting next week I will start to spend more time working on it out of class.<h3>
    

        
    <p>- Network Reference Models  -Finished</p>

        <p>-I learned the layers in the TCP/IP and OSP models and how they can be used to represent order in which items are sent and received over the internet 
        -The TCP/IP model consists of 7 layers of sending and receiving packets
        -The OSP model is a more condensed version of TCP/IP model consisting of only 4 layers
        -The exact same steps are followed in the sending and receiving of packets, except the order changes
    </p>

    <p>- Linux CLI Basics          -Finished</p>

    <p>
        -The most popular CLI(command line interface) for Linux is BASH (Bourne Again Shell)


        -Scripting:(stringing lots of commands together to perform more complicated tasks)


        -Linux is good for repetitive tasks that use scripting 


        -CLI weighs less on the computer system than a standard GUI(graphical user interface)

        
        -Useful if a computing system is overloaded and doesn't have the computing power to support it
