    <h2>Cybrary Outline<h2>
      
    <h3>I have made good progress on Cybrary, and I have figured out how to sign up for access to a practice book to help me get certified for the certified in cybersecurity exam through ISC2 I have worked on Cybrary the whole week during class and starting next week I will start to spend more time working on it out of class.</h3>
    

        
    <h3>- Network Reference Models  -Finished</h3>

        <p>-I learned the layers in the TCP/IP and OSP models and how they can be used to represent order in which items are sent and received over the internet</p>
        <p>-The TCP/IP model consists of 7 layers of sending and receiving packets</p>
        <p>-The OSP model is a more condensed version of TCP/IP model consisting of only 4 layers</p>
        <p>-The exact same steps are followed in the sending and receiving of packets, except the order changes</p>
        <p>-Lab finished</p>

    <h3>- Linux CLI Basics          -Finished</h3>
     
         
    <p>-The most popular CLI(command line interface) for Linux is BASH (Bourne Again Shell)</p>
    <p>-Scripting:(stringing lots of commands together to perform more complicated tasks)</p>
    <p>-Linux is good for repetitive tasks that use scripting</p>
    <p>-Useful if a computing system is overloaded and doesn't have the computing power to support it</p>
    <p>-CLI weighs less on the computer system than a standard GUI(graphical user interface)</p>
    <p>Lab finished</p>

    <h3>- Network Device Basics</h3>

    <p>I used GNS3(Graphical Network Simulator-3) to setup a network where two devices can communicate with themselves</p>
    <p>I had to configure the router and one of the Linux devices so they could communicate with each other</p>
    <p>I learned how to configure a device with DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) by assigning a device with IP addresses.</p>
    <p>Lab Finished</p>

    <img src="Network Device Basics.png" alt="Network Device Basics">

    <h3>- Linux File System Basics</h3>

    <p>I learned commands to look through directories for files named flag containing a word.</p>
    <p>I used the cat command to ask for the information contained in each flag file</p>
    <p>There are diffrent directories that contain information for configuration files, information about things happening on the system, and executable and support files.</p>
    <p>Lab Finished</p>

            <h2>Mentorship Analysis:</h2>
            
            <h3>Mentor Contact Reflection:</h3>

            <h3>What was the first question you asked your mentor this week?</h3>

            <p>The first question I asked my mentor this week was whether the current resource I am using is good for getting the certification in cybersecurity. However, I later found out the answer to my planned first question because John has a CompTIA Security+ sy0-701 certification.</p>

            <h3>ummarize the response from your mentor and analyze how it helps you improve your project. Did it address the challenge? What actions did you take based on the feedback?</h3>

            <p>The response from my mentor helped me improve my project because I got some valuable feedback about the certification I should to take and the resources I should be using. I didn't think my question about whether or not he was certified in cybersecurity was as important as which resources I should or should not be using.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up: How did you use your mentor's guidance to progress in your project? Document how you applied the advice or plan to in the coming week.</h3>

            <p>I used my mentor's guidance to adjust my project goal from getting a certification for certified in cybersecurity to getting a CompTIA Security+ certification because it is the benchmark for many security positions in the field.</p>

            <h2>Unit 7</h2>

            <h3>Obj 1.1 Notes </h3>

            <p>-Technical controls: Software hardware used to reduce risks of breach.</p>

            <p>-Managerial Controls: Planning and deciding security for a network.</p>

            <p>-Operational controls: Day-to-day basis controls controlled through humans or built-in processes</p>

            <p>Physical controls: Real-world management (security).</p>
            
            <h3>Obj. 1.2 Notes</h3>

            <h3>C.I.A.N.A and A.A.A:</h3>

            <p>-Confidentiality: Info is only accessible to those it should be.</p>

            <p>-Integrity: Data is considered accurate and correct, hasn't been modified.</p>

            <p>-Availability: Is considered "up" and accessible for as much time as possible, can be described by up time.</p>

            <p>-Non-repudiation: Something that can prove that something was done and the parties involved cannot claim they were not involved.</p>

            <p>-Authentication: Proving you are who you say you are when trying to gain access to resources.</p>

            <p>-Authorization: Deciding what a certain user can or cannot do and access.</p>

            <p>-Accounting: Properly documenting and taking note of communications from a user during use.</p>

            <p>-Gap Analysis: Look at network and determine possible weaknesses or vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>-Zero Trust: A user must provide indentification regardless of where they are logging in from or who they are.</p>

            <h3>Progress and Documentation: I included all my progress in the Security+ Course for the week above, and I only had one commit.</h3>

            <h3>Challenges: I thought I could complete the course in 60 days, however I did not take any of the suggested prerequisite courses before Security+. I will probably be missing certain information and I will need extra time during the course to learn it. My mentor suggested a timeframe longer than 60 days if possible to make sure I know all the content before taking the exam.</h3>

            <h3>Timeline:</h3>

            <p>I plan to complete the course in about 90-120 days for newer students. This means I should do 30-45 minutes of the course per day, and I should also save some time at the end of class for documentation of work.  I will take a test at the end of the course and it will give me a score that either qualifies me for the certification or doesn't.</p>
