    <h2>Cybrary Outline<h2>
      
    <h3>I have made good progress on Cybrary, and I have figured out how to sign up for access to a practice book to help me get certified for the certified in cybersecurity exam through ISC2 I have worked on Cybrary the whole week during class and starting next week I will start to spend more time working on it out of class.</h3>
    

        
    <h3>- Network Reference Models  -Finished</h3>

        <p>-I learned the layers in the TCP/IP and OSP models and how they can be used to represent order in which items are sent and received over the internet</p>
        <p>-The TCP/IP model consists of 7 layers of sending and receiving packets</p>
        <p>-The OSP model is a more condensed version of TCP/IP model consisting of only 4 layers</p>
        <p>-The exact same steps are followed in the sending and receiving of packets, except the order changes</p>
        <p>-Lab finished</p>

    <h3>- Linux CLI Basics          -Finished</h3>
     
         
    <p>-The most popular CLI(command line interface) for Linux is BASH (Bourne Again Shell)</p>
    <p>-Scripting:(stringing lots of commands together to perform more complicated tasks)</p>
    <p>-Linux is good for repetitive tasks that use scripting</p>
    <p>-Useful if a computing system is overloaded and doesn't have the computing power to support it</p>
    <p>-CLI weighs less on the computer system than a standard GUI(graphical user interface)</p>
    <p>Lab finished</p>

    <h3>- IP Addressing Basics</h3>


    <p>I learned how to use the arp command to display the arp menu in Linux</p>
    <p>I can use a IP address and subnet mask to determine a network address as well as and a device address</p>
    <p>I can use the ifconfig command in Linux to look at network interfaces</p>
    <p>I understand the components of an IP address</p>

    <p>Path 2: Project Development Focus
        For students actively working on their projects:
        Objective: Continue project creation and show incremental daily progress.
        Tasks:
        Daily Project Log: Document each day’s work: I am adding information to my journal daily
        What features or improvements were added today.
        Issues encountered and how they were resolved (or how you plan to address them).
        Screenshots or demos of new functionality.
        Clear commit messages for any code pushed to GitHub.
        Prototype Cleanup: Ensure that any new features are clean, organized, and functional. Make sure GitHub documentation is updated regularly with these changes.
        Project Milestones: Set a milestone for the week—e.g., completing a key feature or polishing a hardware/VR element—and track progress toward that goal.
