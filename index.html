<p>Unit 3: Project Creation and Documentation
    Prototype Cleanup and Refinement
    Objective: Ensure that the prototype created so far is organized and detailed.
    Deliverable: Refactor or improve your initial code/prototype.
    For Software Projects: Make sure you have the prototype detailed with the different features / pages / important components.
    For Hardware Projects: Refine the layout or hardware setup - include links to anything needed to order with cost.
    For VR/AR Projects: Refine the environment, improve textures, or fine-tune interaction models.
    Details: Commit changes to your GitHub repository with clear commit messages indicating what was cleaned up or improved.
    Initial Project Creation
    Objective: Begin building or expanding your project based on your research and prototype.
    Deliverable: Submit the next version of your project with more features or refined functionality.
    For Software Projects: Implement additional features or modules (e.g., adding authentication, database connectivity).
    For Hardware Projects: Add new components or functionality, like sensors or control systems.
    For VR/AR Projects: Expand your environment, add more user interactions, or refine existing elements.
    Learning and Documentation
    Objective: If you are still learning new tools or technologies, document your learning process.
    Deliverable: Submit a detailed log of what you have learned so far.
    Create a “Learning Journal” in your GitHub repository, documenting:
    What tutorials, articles, or videos you've completed.
    Key takeaways and challenges faced.
    How the new knowledge will apply to your project.
    Share links to any code snippets or small prototypes you’ve created while learning.
    Code Documentation
    Objective: Continue documenting your code and process in GitHub.
    Deliverable: Update README.md with:
    A clearer description of your project’s purpose.
    Details on how to run your project (if applicable).
    A list of features currently implemented and planned.
    Submission Deadline:
    End of Week 3 - Sunday midnight 9/8.</p>
