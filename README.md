<h2>Cybrary Notes:<h2>
<p>Research Plan for a Programming Semester Project
1. Define the Project Goal
Objective: Clarify what the project aims to achieve (e.g., solving a problem, creating a new tool, learning a specific technology).A
I plan to create a website using Github that will have cybersecurity activities and CTFs that can be completed by users on the website.
Steps:
Identify Interests: Choose a topic that excites you or is relevant to your career goals (e.g., web development, AI, game design).
Problem Statement: Formulate a clear problem or opportunity that your project will address.
I want to create a website that is accessible to everyone who wants to learn more about cybersecurity, as well as apply concepts through CTFs and other exercises.
Define Success: Determine what success looks like (e.g., a working prototype, a fully functional application, or a learning outcome).
Success for me would be the application of the knowledge I acquire from learning the content through the creation of a website. <p>

<p>2. Conduct Preliminary Research
Objective: Gather information to refine your idea and understand the scope.
Steps:
Literature Review: Look at existing projects or research in your area of interest. Identify gaps or areas for improvement.
Technology Exploration: Research the programming languages, frameworks, and tools that might be used in your project.
Feasibility Analysis: Assess the complexity of the project. Consider your current skills and time constraints.
My larger project will consist of small projects and things I have learned from my project on the topic of cybersecurity.<p>

<p>3. Define Project Requirements
Objective: Outline the technical and functional requirements of the project.
Steps:
User Stories/Use Cases: Write down the functionalities your project should have (e.g., “As a user, I want to be able to log in securely”).
System Requirements: List the technical requirements, including software, hardware, and development environments.
Data Requirements: Identify any data sources, databases, or APIs you’ll need.
I plan to record my findings as well as the applications and how I have information to expand my knowledge.

4. Develop a Project Timeline
Objective: Create a timeline to manage your work throughout the semester.
Steps:
Break Down Tasks: Divide the project into smaller tasks or milestones (e.g., research, design, development, testing).
Set Deadlines: Assign deadlines to each task to keep the project on track.
Allocate Time for Learning: Plan time for learning new technologies or concepts.
I plan to learn about cybersecurity and during the learning, I would like to apply the knowledge about cybersecurity through the course I plan to take at Cybrary.
5. Create a Research and Development Plan
<p>
<p>Objective: Plan how you will approach coding, testing, and validating your project.
Steps:
Algorithm Design: Plan out the key algorithms or logic you’ll need to implement.
Prototyping: Start with a basic prototype or proof of concept to validate your ideas.
Testing Strategy: Define how you will test your code (e.g., unit testing, user testing) and what tools you'll use.
I want to present my information and explain each new concept I learned through the website and its purpose in the field of cybersecurity.

6. Document and Present Findings (Using GitHub)
Objective: Maintain a clear and organized record of your research and development process using GitHub, a platform widely used in the software industry for version control and collaboration.
Steps:
Research Log: Create a README.md file in your GitHub repository where you keep notes of all research activities, including sources, findings, and decisions made throughout the project.
New Github repository was created.
Code Documentation: Use GitHub to manage your codebase. Make sure to:
Commit Regularly: Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages to document your progress.
Branching: Use branches to manage different features or versions of your project without affecting the main codebase.
Pull Requests: If working in a team, use pull requests to review code before merging it into the main branch.
Issues and Project Boards: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and bugs, and Project Boards to organize your workflow.
Final Report/Presentation: Utilize GitHub Pages to host your project's final report or create a project wiki directly on GitHub to present your findings, research process, and project outcomes.
