# Benjamin Dudek Cybersecurity Project Planner
**Cybrary Notes:**
Research Plan for a Programming Semester Project

**1.  Define the Project Goal**
**Objective: Clarify what the project aims to achieve (e.g., solving a problem, creating a new tool, learning a specific technology).**


I plan to create a website using Github that will have the information I learned through the course at Cybrary. There are activities within the course that will allow me to apply my knowledge and later document it on the website.


**Steps:
Identify Interests: Choose a topic that excites you or is relevant to your career goals (e.g., web development, AI, game design).**


I am interested in cybersecurity and IT, however, I do not know much about the topic in general and a project would greatly help me expand my knowledge.


**Problem Statement: Formulate a clear problem or opportunity that your project will address.**


I want to create a website that is accessible to everyone who wants to learn more about cybersecurity, as well as document my research and what I learned through the application of this course and possibly various other courses. I also want to participate in the HackVh event hosted by the school to put my skills that I have been learning throughout the year to the test.


**Define Success: Determine what success looks like (e.g., a working prototype, a fully functional application, or a learning outcome).**


Success for me would be the application of the knowledge I acquire from learning the content through the creation of a website and participation in the HackVH event in March 2025.

**2.  Conduct Preliminary Research
Objective: Gather information to refine your idea and understand the scope.
Steps:
Literature Review: Look at existing projects or research in your area of interest. Identify gaps or areas for improvement.**


**Technology Exploration: Research the programming languages, frameworks, and tools that might be used in your project.**


**Feasibility Analysis: Assess the complexity of the project. Consider your current skills and time constraints.**


My larger project will consist of small projects and things I have learned from my project on the topic of cybersecurity. I will be doing a lot of my learning through the program, wireshark, because of its ability to represent learning topics through labs. My project will be fairly complex because of the amount of topics I plan to learn and apply through labs. The HackVh competition will be complex in the prompt we are given to create a solution for. (Info will be documented after the HackVH event on Github). I also have a lot of time from September to March to learn integral cybersecurity and IT concepts for the event.


**3.  Define Project Requirements**
**Objective: Outline the technical and functional requirements of the project.**
**Steps:**
**User Stories/Use Cases: Write down the functionalities your project should have (e.g., “As a user, I want to be able to log in securely”).**


**System Requirements: List the technical requirements, including software, hardware, and development environments.**


**Data Requirements: Identify any data sources, databases, or APIs you’ll need.**


I plan to keep track of the topics I have learned through Cybrary, and this will help me keep track of what I still need to the learn for the HackVh competition. I will be using Cybrary and applying to various courses throughout my project. I also plan to utilize Khan Academy if I need help with the html on my website. Software for project listed above. Lastly, our project should meet the evaluation criteria for the event and I plan to record all of this info after winners are announced and feedback is given.


**4.  Develop a Project Timeline**
**Objective: Create a timeline to manage your work throughout the semester.**
**Steps:**


**Break Down Tasks: Divide the project into smaller tasks or milestones (e.g., research, design, development, testing).**


**Set Deadlines: Assign deadlines to each task to keep the project on track.**


**Allocate Time for Learning: Plan time for learning new technologies or concepts.**


Currently, I am enrolled in a 40-hour course for IT and Cybersecurity fundamentals in Cybrary. I plan to utilize all the class time I have available to do work in the course and completing the course should take me about 55 days in total. However, I will take days or part of days to document my progress in between learning days. Essentially, I will be working on my website during my enrollment in the course. I am also going to enter into the hackVH event in March next year as part of my culmintating project.


**5.  Create a Research and Development Plan**
**Objective: Plan how you will approach coding, testing, and validating your project.**
**Steps:**
**Algorithm Design: Plan out the key algorithms or logic you’ll need to implement.**


**Prototyping: Start with a basic prototype or proof of concept to validate your ideas.**


**Testing Strategy: Define how you will test your code (e.g., unit testing, user testing) and what tools you'll use.**


I want to present my information and explain each new concept I learned through the website and its purpose in the field of cybersecurity. Also, I would like to make sure that I learn many of the concepts that are important to know in cybersecurity and IT. When I do the HackVH event my team's project will be scored by the judges and that will be the evaluation of my part of code in the project.


**6.  Document and Present Findings (Using GitHub)
Objective: Maintain a clear and organized record of your research and development process using GitHub, a platform widely used in the software industry for version control and collaboration.
Steps:
Research Log: Create a README.md file in your GitHub repository where you keep notes of all research activities, including sources, findings, and decisions made throughout the project.**


New Github repository was created. Branches for specific needs will be created during the project.


**Code Documentation: Use GitHub to manage your codebase. Make sure to:**


**Commit Regularly: Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages to document your progress.**


**Branching: Use branches to manage different features or versions of your project without affecting the main codebase.**


**Pull Requests: If working in a team, use pull requests to review code before merging it into the main branch.**


**Issues and Project Boards: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and bugs, and Project Boards to organize your workflow.**


**Final Report/Presentation: Utilize GitHub Pages to host your project's final report or create a project wiki directly on GitHub to present your findings, research process, and project outcomes.**
